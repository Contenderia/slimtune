SlimTune
========

A free profiling and performance tuning tool for .NET applications

This is a fork of the original [SlimTune](https://code.google.com/p/slimtune/) project, a profiling tool for .NET that has lay dormant as an early beta since 2011. Despite the lack of maintenance it still works against .NET 4.5.1 applications including WPF, and hopefully some of the bugs and UI issues can be fixed.

Backwards compatibility is not a goal and some features may be dropped rather than maintaining them.
